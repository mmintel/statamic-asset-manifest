# statamic-asset-manifest
Addon for [Statamic](https://statamic.com?rfsn=1226699.c208cc): searches occurences of files and replaces them as listed in the manifest

`git submodule add git@github.com:mmintel/statamic-asset-manifest.git site/addons/AssetManifest`

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/edcs/laravel-mix-statamic.

# Todo
* make manifest configurable
* make file paths configurable
